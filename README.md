# DonkeyScan

This tool can not only be used to lessen the burden of remembering the nmap scripts and their uses, but now the canges include adding a new module [Enumerator](https://github.com/Praman1997/Enumerator).<br>
Especially for people like me who like to take shortcuts

## Installing the tool
* First, change the permissions of `install.py` to execute and then run `install.py`
> $ sudo chmod +x install.py

> $ sudo ./install.py
* After installation, simply run the program using the command ```sudo dscan```
(You will have to run the tool using sudo privileges...)
