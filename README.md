# DonkeyScanner

This tool can be used to lessen the burden of remembering the nmap scripts and their uses, along with a new module [Enumerator](https://github.com/Praman1997/Enumerator).<br>
Especially for people like me who like to take shortcuts

## Installing the tool
* First, change the permissions of `install.py` to execute and then run `install.py`
> $ sudo chmod +x install.py

> $ sudo ./install.py

OR, simply,

> $ sudo python install.py
* After installation, simply run the program using the command ```sudo dscan``` or '```dscan```(if already root)
(If not, you will have to run the tool using sudo privileges...)
